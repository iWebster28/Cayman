## DAW Macro Footswitch Pedal 
I created this project to enhance my music composition workflow. As an avid pianist, I love to compose music just as much as I love to perform it. A few years back, I realized that I had difficulty with recording multiple takes in a single recording session. Frustrated by the innefficiencies of the computer keyboard 'shortcuts,' I decided to come up with my own solution to avoid pressing 'spacebar, delete, enter, and r' every time I wanted to re-record a take while composing a song.
