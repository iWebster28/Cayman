## DAW Macro Footswitch Pedal 
I created this project to enhance my music composition workflow. As an avid pianist, I love to compose music just as much as I love to perform it. A few years back, I realized that I had difficulty with recording multiple takes in a single recording session. Frustrated by the innefficiencies of the computer keyboard 'shortcuts,' I decided to come up with my own solution to avoid pressing 'spacebar, delete, enter, and r' every time I wanted to re-record a take while composing a song.

## Robotic Hand
This project was made for a Biology project on Biomechanical Engineering in Grade 12. After watching various YouTube tutorials, I decided to construct a robotic hand that mimics real-time movement of a glove worn by the human hand. The project allowed me to explore the uses of linear resistive control with an Arduino microcontroller and 5 hobby servos. Since flex sensors were not readily available to me, I constructed them using pairs of aluminum foil tape, cardboard, and electrical tape. After multiple calibrations, each sensor was ready for use the glove. In the end, I had a working model of a myoelectric limb, a type of prosthetic used for amputees or those with congenital limb loss.
