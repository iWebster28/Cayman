## About Me
Hi, I'm Ian - a third year undergrad studying computer engineering at the University of Toronto. As a naturally curious and creative individual, I strive to stay a constant learner, focusing on the things I am passionate about. If I'm not building something at a hackathon or for a personal project, I'm designing or automating, streamlining a workflow, writing and/or playing music with others, or out exploring, hiking or running.   

## Contact Information

## Projects
A library of projects I have completed over the years can be found in my Project Library [here](./project-library.html).
