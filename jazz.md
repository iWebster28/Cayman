## Music and I
I've had a bit of history with music. I began taking piano lessons when I was 4 years old. After practicing classical for 10 years, I decided to start exploring other genres: video game soundtracks, orchestral arrangements and jazz. Throughout highschool, I was a part of multiple bands (jazz, concert, and pit orchestra), playing the tenor saxophone and piano. At this time, I began discovering my interest in jazz. I began lessons with the renowned Canadian jazz pianist Steve Holt. A few friends and I formed a band called LMJC, and began performing gigs regularly at a restaurant called Hot Belly Mama's. We played at venues such as Trent University, Long and McQuade music stores, Mercedes-Benz, and various pubs in Peterborough, ON. During the Terry Fox Campaign in 2017, our band campaigned to raise money for cancer research. Currently, I am the pianist for the engineering stageband 'blue' at the University of Toronto.
